# About the collection

This is the collection of letters A from illustrated books in [Cotsen Children's library](https://cotsen.princeton.edu/). 

Illustrators of alphabet books have a lot of choice in which subject would best illustrate a letter. We have examples from different countries and eras, in a variety of artistic styles.
